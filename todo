# Tasks (in more or less prioritized order)

V* create f:nction to download mnist (check if it is already downloaded)
V* load digit, and save it in different place (perhaps using Pillow ?)
V* choose which format to use for output videos -> for now folder with separate images
V* load digit, save it in bigger image
V* create function for realistic position and scale motion

V* load digit, duplicate image info video frames and save video
* pick random digit
