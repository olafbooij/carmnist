# Tasks (in more or less prioritized order)

V* create f:nction to download mnist (check if it is already downloaded)
V* load digit, and save it in different place (perhaps using Pillow ?)
V* choose which format to use for output videos -> for now folder with separate images
V* load digit, save it in bigger image
V* create function for realistic position and scale motion

V* load digit, duplicate image info video frames and save video
* pick random digit
* load image directly using mnist.load_data() instead of saving them locally using  extract_images_mnist_database 
* make the camera rotation of the motion a bit bigger
* make the translation spped a bit smaller (so the digit is a on average a bit bigger)
* replace the mockup in the readme to ones produced by digit_in_motion
* create a lot of videos
* choose which format to use for labels (seems no common format)
* save bounding box (=label)
* create function to change position and scale of digit
* create standard setup file
